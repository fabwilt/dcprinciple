                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Regulating and managing today’s supply chains and the interlinked organizations, suppliers and goods distributors involved in the sale of products has become extremely complex. Supply chains can get stretched over innumerable stages based on the kind of products. These stages comprise different geographical locations, multiple invoices and payments, several distributors and an extended span of months and years. Since its advent, supply chain management has functioned as a complicated space consisting of multitudes of channels.
<br>
<br>Even before the onset of Covid-19, global supply chain management was affected by the shortcomings of web2. As per a report by WIRED, the supply chain is too complex, interconnected and fragile to be made vulnerable to global pandemics. Their report could 80% predict what would happen, and 20% predict unforeseen circumstances as a margin of error.
<br>
<br>Web2-based supply chain management lacks the traceability and predictive monitoring required to check what is done at different stages of production. It caused stakeholders like regulators and advocates in the management committee to pay high prices. Web2 has done restrictive and unsecured innovations for the global shipping and supply chain and logistics industries that do not drive any reasonable economic value to them.
<br>
<br>To understand clearly, the global industries heavily rely upon paper in context to the ‘bill of lading.’ According to a Forbes article, the bill of lading’s digital version, introduced more than two decades ago, accounts for hardly 0.5% of global trade. This is because of the highly segmented and complex flow of global trade.
<br>
<br>Supply chains consist of disparate and competing groups of people that exchange data to coordinate with each other on supply chains. Therefore, the need to share data often leads to delays in information processing in supply chains, inconsistency in the chain flow and distrust among the supply chain participants. This results in the incompetency of supply chains, which becomes a major barrier to digital transformation.
<br>
<br>When it comes to innovating supply chain management and logistics, web3 acts as a boon. It offers a decentralized infrastructure for highly secured data sharing that functions as an alternative paradigm to function with robust blockchain protocols.<br>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>What is Web3 in supply chains and logistics?</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The growth of the global economy constantly places a lot of emphasis on logistics and supply chain management. This happens specifically based on the present day’s shipping backlog at all global key ports and the diminishing availability of goods in shops. Web3, when integrated with supply chains and logistics, offers a multitude of benefits like decentralized data management, aggregation and control of supply chain components.
<br>
<br>The automation of supply chain management and logistics using web3 is not just about blockchain; it is an amalgamation of technologies like artificial intelligence, smart contracts written in web3-specific programming languages, and distributed ledgers. All these make up the fundamental stack of web3 integrated supply chain and logistics.
<br>
<br>Supply chain and logistics using web3 facilitate an open record keeping of all the linking documents of the supply chain flow. It demonstrates seamless data coordination from all the supply chain participants, like different organizers, suppliers, etc.
<br>
<br>Web3 integrated supply chain provides increased transparency and reduced cost and risk throughout the supply chain management and logistics regulation. It relatively increases the material supply chain’s traceability to ensure that all the corporate standards are truly fulfilled.
<br>
<br>Along with minimum paperwork and reduced administrative costs, web3, when integrated into the supply chain management, improves visibility and compliance in regard to outsourced contract manufacturing.
<br>
<br>Web3 in supply chain management also reduces the losses from counterfeit or gray market trading. It also manages supply chain components and improves accuracy with high-level end-to-end tracking.
<br>
<br>Using web3, it is possible to digitally transform physical assets and build a decentralized, distributed ledger and distributed record of transactions. This, in turn, makes it possible to seamlessly track the flow of assets from their production to their delivery. Web3 integrated supply chain also provides detailed product history and improved transparency. This offers benefits like increased visibility to consumers and businesses.
<br>
<br>Another important aspect of web3 supply chain management is identity verification. It plays a huge role in web3 supply chain management and logistics. It provides clear information on when and who is responsible for the flow of goods and merchandise in the supply chain regulation.<br>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>What are the features of a web3 supply chain?</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Web3 integrated supply chain and logistics are highly secure in nature and have the following distinctive attributes:
<br>
<br><strong>Seamless tracking
</strong><br>Supply chain and logistics using web3 have distributed ledger, which ensures that the supply chain participants seamlessly track and monitor the end-to-end history of all the activities beginning from orders, manufacturing workflow, and payments to packaging and good transportation on a real-time basis.
<br>
<br><strong>Automated record keeping
</strong><br>All the supply chain and logistics transactions taking place between the participants and all relevant information from the linked systems, like ERPs, IoT data management base, etc., are validated automatically. They are then safely stored in the distributed web3 ledgers.
<br>
<br><strong>Verified supplier data
</strong><br>Web3’s fundamental technology is blockchain which offers suppliers with identity management and verification features. It enables supplier data validation by trusted validators and provides an immutable audit trail for all the suppliers on-chain.
<br>
<br><strong>Automation using smart contract
</strong><br>Smart contracts have pre-set instructions and clauses to regulate supply chain and logistic transactions automatically. These clauses are pre-decided and agreed upon by all the relevant parties involved in the web3 supply chain. Automation takes place when all the clauses and pre-set conditions are met, for instance, monitoring all the goods and logistical metrics, checking transportation compliance at pre-set regular intervals, and processing a payment to the relevant supplier on timely product delivery.
<br>
<br><strong>Timestamping and hashing 
</strong><br>Web3 supply chain and logistics generally work by generating a hash value on the blockchain. This ensures that all the data blocks in the blockchain network have their distinctive cryptographic identifier value. In case the supply chain data in one of the blocks is altered or changed, then the hash value of all the continuing blocks will be altered. This timestamping and hashing makes the web3 supply chain and logistics data secure and tamper-free.
<br>
<br><strong>Security
</strong><br>Web3, when integrated with supply chain and logistics management, achieves high security and offers data encryption, multi-factor authentication, permission-less chain access &amp; control, fraud detection algorithms, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>Digital transaction signing
</strong><br>Participants of the web3 supply chain have their respective digital signatures to seamlessly e-sign the supply chain transaction and get their ownership validated.
<br>
<br><strong>Audit trail for documents
</strong><br>Web3 supply chain is fundamentally based on blockchain technology and, thus, keeps track of all changes made to contracts, sales and purchase orders, bills of lading, product certificates, manufacturing configurations, quality assurance reports, and other crucial supply chain reports. It also records information about report generation, formatting, viewing and sharing.
<br>
<br><strong>Registered supply chain &amp; logistics components
</strong><br>Blockchain in the web3 supply chain enables users to separate and batch the onboarding of all products, documents and locations in relation to supply chain transactions and events. Also, the codes of the supply chain components are in accordance with the GS1(Global Traceability Standards) to keep the supply chain, and logistics regulation tallied and upright by maintaining a unified data record and seamless product tracking.
<br>
<br><strong>Data validation
</strong><br>Web3 supply chain and logistic transactions are validated by authorized supply chain participants with special validating rights. These transaction validators achieve transaction consensus and storage order using selective endorsement on-chain.<br>
